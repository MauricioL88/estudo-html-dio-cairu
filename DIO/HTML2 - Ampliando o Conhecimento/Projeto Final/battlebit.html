        <h2 id="resumo">Resumo</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>BattleBit Remastered</strong> is a massively multiplayer online first-person shooter developed by a
          team of three indie
          developers—SgtOkiDoki, Vilaskis, and TheLiquidHorse—and published by SgtOkiDoki for Microsoft Windows
          exclusively through the Steam distribution platform. Loosely set during a conflict between the United States
          and Russia, BattleBit allows up to 254 players to compete in player versus player matches on large maps. The
          game is strongly inspired by the Battlefield series by DICE, with similar gameplay mechanics to earlier
          entries in that series such as team-oriented character classes and destructible environments.
          <br>
          <br>
          BattleBit was released in early access on June 15, 2023 to considerable financial success and popularity, with
          over 1.8 million copies sold within its first two weeks of release. It was also critically acclaimed for its
          teamwork-oriented gameplay, low poly visuals, user-friendly game design, and overall simplicity and
          uniqueness.

        <h2 id="modo">Gameplay</h2>
        <p>
          BattleBit has multiple game modes that vary based on the server size selected in matchmaking. Each mode has
          different types of maps and varying accessibility to vehicles. Players vote in a blind poll at the end of each
          match to decide upon the next map and game mode accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though a total of at least eighteen game modes are planned, only six have been implemented as of Update 1.9.3
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Conquest:</strong> A large-scale mode where both teams fight to capture control points and whittle the enemy team's
            respawn tickets. As the maps used in Conquest are large, both teams have access to vehicles to help
            transport and support advances.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Infantry Conquest:</strong> Conquest but only featuring transport-oriented vehicles, so as to focus on infantry
            combat.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Domination:</strong> Essentially a smaller-scale version of Conquest with fewer control points, no vehicles, and a
            smaller map.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Capture the Flag:</strong> A capture the flag mode where both teams fight to steal the enemy team's flag while
            protecting their own.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Frontlines:</strong> A tug of war-esque mode where both teams advance through the map by capturing pairs of control
            points at a time (called "sectors"), while preventing the enemy team from advancing on them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rush:</strong> An attack-versus-defend mode where one team must attack and destroy various military communications
            stations, while the other team must defend them. It is not available in 254-player servers.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Other modes that are present as filters in the server browser but are not yet implemented in the game itself
          are Team Deathmatch, Free For All, Elimination, Gun Game (Free for All), Gun Game (Team), Advance and
          Secure, Suicide Rush, Catch Game, Cash Run, Infected, Voxel Fortify, and Voxel Trench.
